Examples
========

The Evolver project includes many examples that demonstrate how to use the framework. These examples are located in the ``org.uma.evolver.algorithm.example.meta`` package, which contains examples of meta-optimization algorithms (mostly NSGA-II), but also SMPSO and the asynchronous version of NSGA-II) applied to the available base-level metaheuristics using different traning sets.
