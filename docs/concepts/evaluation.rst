Solution Evaluation
==================

Evaluation is a critical component of the meta-optimization process in Evolver. This document explains how configurations are evaluated and how their quality is assessed.

Evaluation Process
------------------

Given a solution generated by the variation operators of the meta-optimizer algorithm, evaluating it implies running the base-level metaheuristic on the set of :math:`P` base-level problems. As metaheuristics are stochastic techniques, a number :math:`N` of independent runs per each combination of <configuration, problem> should be performed if we want to have results with statistical confidence.

Given the list of quality indicators (the objective functions), each of them is applied to the resulting fronts of the :math:`N` independent runs. Then the objectives are computed in two steps:

#. For each problem, the median of the quality indicators for the :math:`N` runs is calculated.
#. For each quality indicator, the mean value of the medians of each problem is the resulting objective value.

:math:`N` is a parameter of the meta-optimization problem and it must be set carefully because it can have a high impact on the total running time of the meta-optimization process. By default, :math:`N` is equal to 1.
